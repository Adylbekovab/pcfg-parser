No , it was n't Black Monday .
The finger has already begun .
`` The equity market was illiquid .
When the dollar is in a free , even central banks ca n't stop it .
Speculators are calling for a degree of liquidity that is not there in the market . ''
Final trading accelerated to 108.1 million shares , a record for the Big Board .
At the end of the day , 251.2 million shares were traded .
The Dow Jones industrials closed at 2569.26 .
The Dow 's decline was second in point terms only to the 508 Black Monday crash that occurred Oct. 19 , 1987 .
The Dow fell 22.6 % on Black Monday .
At 2:43 p.m. EDT , came the sickening news : The Big Board was halting trading in UAL , `` pending news . ''
Several traders could be seen shaking their heads when the news flashed .
At this point , the Dow was down about 35 points .
The market crumbled .
Arbitragers could n't dump their UAL stock -- but they rid themselves of nearly every `` rumor '' stock they had .
These stocks eventually reopened .
But as panic spread , speculators began to sell blue stocks such as Philip Morris and International Business Machines to offset their losses .
Selling snowballed because of waves of automatic `` stop '' orders , which are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels .
Most of the stock selling pressure came from Wall Street professionals , including computer program traders .
Traders said most of their major institutional investors , on the other hand , sat tight .
Under an agreement signed by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , trading was temporarily halted in Chicago .
As a result , the link between the futures and stock markets ripped apart .
The futures halt was even assailed by Big Board floor traders .
`` We did n't even get a chance to do the programs we wanted to do . ''
But stocks kept falling .
The Dow industrials were down 55 points at 3 p.m. before the futures halt .
At 3:30 p.m. , at the end of the `` cooling off '' period , the average was down 114.76 points .
Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan said yesterday the circuit breaker `` worked well mechanically .
I just think it 's nonproductive at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things . ''
Buyers stepped in to the futures pit .
But the build of S&P futures sell orders weighed on the market , and the link with stocks began to fray again .
Futures traders say the S&P was signaling that the Dow could fall as much as 200 points .
During this time , small investors began ringing their brokers , wondering whether another crash had begun .
At Prudential Securities Inc. , which is trying to cater to small investors , some demoralized brokers thought this would be the final confidence .
`` I have a hunch that this particular decline today is something ` more ado about less . '
And I think a lot of people will harp on program trading .
It 's going to bring the debate right back to the forefront . ''
As the Dow average ground to its final 190.58 loss Friday , the S&P pit stayed locked at its 30 trading limit .
But there were no buyers .
Stock futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself .
But nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today .
The Big Board 's Mr. Grasso said , `` Our systemic performance was good . ''
But the exchange will `` look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks .
Obviously we 'll take a close look at any situation in which we think the dealer obligations were n't met , '' he said .

Unlike the weekend before Black Monday , the funds were n't swamped with heavy withdrawal requests .
And many fund managers have built up cash levels and say they will be buying stock this week .
The Boston firm said stock redemptions were running at less than one the level two years ago .
`` This feels more like a one deal .
People are n't panicking . ''
The test may come today .
Friday 's stock market sell came too late for many investors to act .
Some shareholders have held off until today because any fund exchanges made after Friday 's close would take place at today 's closing prices .
But fund managers say they 're ready .
Many have raised cash levels , which act as a buffer against steep market declines .
Mario Gabelli , for instance , holds cash positions well above 20 % in several of his funds .
Not all funds have raised cash levels , of course .
That was modestly higher than the 8.8 % and 9.2 % levels in August and September of 1987 .
Also , persistent redemptions would force some fund managers to dump stocks to raise cash .
But a strong level of investor withdrawals is much more unlikely this time around , fund managers said .
A major reason is that investors already have sharply scaled back their purchases of stock funds since Black Monday .
Stock sales have rebounded in recent months , but monthly net purchases are still running at less than half 1987 levels .
Many fund managers argue that now 's the time to buy .
Fidelity 's Mr. Lynch , for his part , snapped up Southern Co. shares Friday after the stock got hammered .

When the price of plastics took off in 1987 , Quantum Chemical Corp. went along for the ride .
The company outpaced much of the chemical industry as annual profit grew fivefold in two years .
Mr. Stookey said of the boom , `` It 's going to last a whole lot longer than anybody thinks . ''
But now prices have nose and Quantum 's profit is plummeting .
To a degree , Quantum represents the new times that have arrived for producers of the so commodity plastics that pervade modern life .
Having just passed through one of the most profitable periods in their history , these producers now see their prices eroding .
Pricing cycles , to be sure , are nothing new for plastics producers .
And the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the heady period that is just behind them .
`` Now we 're at the bottom of the heap . ''
At Quantum , which is based in New York , the trouble is magnified by the company 's heavy dependence on plastics .
In the U.S. polyethylene market , Quantum has claimed the largest share , about 20 % .
In recent months the price of polyethylene , even more than that of other commodity plastics , has taken a dive .
Meanwhile , the price of ethylene , the chemical building block of polyethylene , has n't dropped nearly so fast .
That discrepancy hurts Quantum badly , because its own plants cover only about half of its ethylene needs .
By many accounts , an early hint of a price rout in the making came at the start of this year .
China , which had been putting in huge orders for polyethylene , abruptly halted them .
`` People were even hoarding bags , '' he says .
Now producers hope prices have hit bottom .
They recently announced increases of a few cents a pound to take effect in the next several weeks .
One doubter is George Krug , a chemical analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. and a bear on plastics stocks .
Noting others ' estimates of when price increases can be sustained , he remarks , `` Some say October .
Some say November .
I say 1992 . ''
He argues that efforts to firm up prices will be undermined by producers ' plans to expand production capacity .
A quick turnaround is crucial to Quantum because its cash requirements remain heavy .
The company is trying to carry out a three , $ 1.3 billion plant program started this year .
Some analysts saw the payment as an effort also to dispel takeover speculation .
Some viewed his response -- that company directors review the dividend regularly -- as nothing more than the standard line from executives .
But others came away thinking he had given something less than his usual straight performance .
In any case , on the day of the meeting , Quantum 's shares slid $ 2.625 to $ 36.625 in Big Board trading .
On top of everything else , Quantum confronts a disaster at its plant in Morris , Ill .
Then a second explosion occurred .
Two workers died and six remain in the hospital .
This human toll adds the most painful dimension yet to the sudden change in Quantum 's fortunes .
Until this year , the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up trade safety awards .
A prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another imponderable into Quantum 's financial future .
When a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand , calculating lost profit and thus claims under business insurance is straightforward .
But the numbers become trickier -- and subject to dickering between insured and insurer -- when demand is shifting .
`` And then you still have to negotiate . ''
Quantum hopes the Morris plant , where limited production got under way last week , will resume full operation by year 's end .
The plant usually accounts for 20 % to 25 % of Quantum 's polyethylene production and 50 % of its ethylene production .
Not everything looks grim for Quantum .
The plant expansion should strengthen the company 's sway in the polyethylene business , where market share is often taken through sheer capacity .
By lifting ethylene production , the expansion will also lower the company 's raw material costs .
Quantum is also tightening its grip on its one large business outside chemicals , propane marketing .
Petrolane is the second propane distributor in the U.S. .
The largest , Suburban Propane , was already owned by Quantum .
Still , Quantum has a crisis to get past right now .
Some analysts speculate the weakening stock may yet attract a suitor .

In recent years , U.S. steelmakers have supplied about 80 % of the 100 million tons of steel used annually by the nation .
Some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the U.S. that are similar to quotas .
The Bush administration earlier this year said it would extend steel quotas , known as voluntary restraint agreements , until March 31 , 1992 .
The U.S. termed its plan , a `` trade liberalization program , '' despite the fact that it is merely an extension .
South Korea , which had 1.9 % under the previous quotas , is set to get a small increase to about 1.95 % .
